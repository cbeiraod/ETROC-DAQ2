# ETROC-DAQ++
A new and improved DAQ for standalone ETROC testing

This is currently a placeholder for the ETROC-DAQ++ project.

You can install the DAQ with: `python -m pip install ETROC-DAQ2`

After installation, you can run the main DAQ process with: `run_etroc_daq2`

Once the DAQ process is running, you can interact with it from any python environment using the DAQInterface class from the etroc_daq2 library.
